# Objects
Imagine you want to make a variable in your code that represents a
student ID card:

![student ID card example](.guides/images/id-card.png) {.s12 .m8}

How would you put all that information into a single variable?

*Objects*{.voc} let you do just that.

## How to make an object
In Javascript, an *Object*{.voc} is a collection of variables, which are
called *properties*{.voc}. Each property has a *key*{.voc} (the property
name) and a *value*{.voc} (the data being stored).

Here's what an object looks like in code:

![object code diagram](.guides/images/object.png) {.s12}

::: infobox
Note how the object is defined using opening and closing 
[[{]] curly brackets [[}]].

Each key is followed by a [[:]], and each property is followed by a [[,]].

## Using dot notation
To access the values in our object, we use *dot notation*{.voc}.
Simply put a dot before the key name you want to access. If our
object is stored in a variable called `student`, we can access the
`firstName` key using `student.firstName`: 

```javascript {.console}
> student.firstName;
< "Elizabeth"
```

## Using square bracket notation
Another way to access properties in our object is by putting the key
name as a string in square brackets:

```javascript {.console}
> student["firstName"];
< "Elizabeth"
```
